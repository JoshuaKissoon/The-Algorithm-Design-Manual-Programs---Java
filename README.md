The Algorithm Design Manual Programs (Java)
===========================================

Lately I have been reading the textbook "The Algorithm Design Manual (2nd ed)" by Steven S. Skiena. This repository contain my implementations of the different problems and exercises from the textbook.

I try to build my programs with good coding conventions and designs in mind to make the implementations very re-usable and easily understadable. Feel free to suggest any improvements or changes that can improve these implementations.

Note: The implementation is bundled in a Netbeans project for those using Netbeans
