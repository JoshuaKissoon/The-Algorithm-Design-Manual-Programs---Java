The Algorithm Design Manual Programs (Java)
===========================================

Lately I have been reading the textbook "The Algorithm Design Manual (2nd ed)" by Steven S. Skiena. This repository contain my implementations of the different problems and exercises from the textbook.

While implementing these programs, I try to build my programs with good coding conventions and designs in mind and also to make the implementations very re-usable and easily understadable. 

Feel free to suggest improvements of major changes to my implementations as well as to provide any structured criticisms on my implementations and how I can improve them. 

Note: The implementation is bundled in a Netbeans project for those using Netbeans
